### üöÄ About Me

I'm a seasoned Backend Developer with over **5 years of experience** specializing in building scalable and robust cloud-native applications. My expertise lies in designing and implementing high-performance backend systems, managing data persistence, and automating infrastructure.

Currently, I'm intensely focused on expanding my capabilities in **Java Spring Boot**, with a comprehensive deep dive into **Microservices architecture, Spring Security, and advanced enterprise-grade API development**. I'm actively applying these concepts in personal projects to build highly maintainable, secure, and scalable solutions.

### üí° My Expertise & Focus

* **Cloud Development:** AWS (Serverless: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, RDS), Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK, CloudFormation), Networking (VPC, Route 53), IAM, Monitoring (CloudWatch). Also experienced with Firebase FCM for push notifications.
* **Backend Development:**
    * **Python:** Building efficient serverless APIs (AWS Chalice), data integration, and multi-tenant architectures.
    * **Java (Current Focus):** Comprehensive understanding and practical application of **Spring Boot (core concepts to advanced), Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, RESTful APIs, Microservices patterns, and Spring Security**.
* **Database Management:** DynamoDB, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
* **DevOps & CI/CD:** Implementing streamlined pipelines (AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions) for continuous integration and deployment.
* **Software Design:** Applying principles of Clean Architecture and design patterns to build resilient and extensible systems.
