👋 Hi there, I'm Satyanand Mishra

👀 I'm a passionate software developer with over 5 years of experience. My journey in tech has seen me work across multiple technologies and frameworks, including:
    Languages: Python, Java
    Frameworks: Spring Boot
    Cloud: AWS, Serverless
    API Development: REST APIs

🌱 I'm currently diving deep into "Clean Architecture (Book by Robert Cecil Martin)" to enhance my software design skills and build more maintainable, scalable applications.

💞️ I'm open to collaboration on any exciting projects, especially those involving:
    Cloud Computing (AWS, Serverless)
    Backend Development (Java Spring Boot, Python)
    API Development (RESTful Services)
    Feel free to suggest what we can work on together!

⚡ Fun Fact: I love walking and spiritual practices such as meditating and listening to slow, calm music. These activities help me stay balanced and focused in my daily life.
